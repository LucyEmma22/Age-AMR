Investigating The Relationship Between Host Age &amp; Antibiotic Resistance Frequency

The level of antibiotic consumption and incidence of bacterial infections are major determinants for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance, however both vary markedly with host age. Does this translate into a correlation between antibiotic resistance frequency and host age? Though many studies have posited this question in specific contexts, there is no general consensus on the strength or form of such a relationship. Here we employ a meta-analysis to consolidate and compare these previous studies and examine the relationship between antibiotic resistance and host age across bacteria and antibiotics. We show that although there is a correlation between age and resistance frequency, diverse patterns exist across antibiotic classes and bacterial genera. We further illustrate, using a mathematical model, that this variation can be driven by differences in antibiotic consumption or incidence of bacterial infection/carriage between age groups, combined with age assortative transmission. These findings imply that empirical antibiotic therapy could be improved by considering age-specific local resistance levels (compared with overall local resistance levels), resulting in improved treatment success and reduced spread of antibiotic resistance. They additionally display consequences of assuming population homogeneity and mass action in epidemiological models. Finally, they indicate that the landscape of the already severe resistance crisis is likely to change as the age of the human population increases.
