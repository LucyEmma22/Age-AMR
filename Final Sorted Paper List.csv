All the AFB culture tests were performed prior to initiation of anti-TB treatment, and the DSTs were performed using the earliest Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolate. If AFB culture result after 3 months of anti-TB treatment was positive, the second DST was performed based on the Korean TB guidelines. If a patient had more than one DST result, only the earliest result was obtained. If a patient had DST results for both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary specimens, results for the pulmonary specimen only were used. DST was performed in a supranational reference laboratory (Korean institute of Tuberculosis, Osong, South Korea) or other commercial reference laboratories. Workflows used and references of critical concentrations for resistance were the same in all reference laboratories. The drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was determined using an absolute concentration method with Lowenstein-Jensen medium, as recommended by the WHO [9]. Anti-TB drugs used and their critical concentrations for resistance were as follows: INH, 0.2 μg/mL; RIF, 40 μg/mL; ethambutol, 2.0 μg/mL; rifabutin, 20 μg/mL; streptomycin, 10 μg/mL; amikacin, 40 μg/mL; kanamycin, 40 μg/mL; capreomycin, 40 μg/mL; ofloxacin, 2.0 μg/mL; levofloxacin, 2.0 μg/mL; moxifloxacin, 2.0 μg/mL; prothionamide, 40 μg/mL; cycloserine, 30 μg/mL; para-aminosalicylic acid, 1.0 μg/mL. Pyrazinamide susceptibility was determined via pyrazinamidase test.","We included native patients age ≥ 15 years who were diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB and who had available results of phenotypic drug-susceptibility test (DST) at eight university-affiliated hospitals in the Seoul metropolitan area and Daejeon between January 2015 and December 2018. Patients under the age of 15 and foreign-born patients were excluded. We excluded culture-confirmed cases without DST results, culture-negative cases, and clinically (radiologically, histologically or through a therapeutic response to anti-TB therapy) diagnosed cases. We retrospectively reviewed medical records and collected age, gender, history of previous TB treatment, location of TB, and phenotypic DST data. Previous TB history was assessed by physicians via patient history-taking. All the enrolled patients were received anti-TB treatment regimen based on the Korean TB guideline, which was first published in 2011. TB patients were initially treated with first-line regimen and later their treatment regimens were modified according to the DST results or clinical response.","After excluding 18 patients aged < 15 years and 227 foreign-born patients, 4417 native patients with TB, aged ≥15 years, were included in this analysis.

Automated bacterial identification and susceptibility testing was conducted on positive urine cultures using the BD Phoenix automated microbiology system (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). Antibiotic susceptibility was interpreted using the CLSI 2015 breakpoint criteria (6). Intermediate susceptibility was considered nonsusceptible. An E. coli cefazolin breakpoint of ≤2 μg/ml was used as a surrogate for cephalexin susceptibility. An exploratory analysis was performed using the urinary cefazolin breakpoint of ≤16 μg as a surrogate for cephalexin susceptibility in study patients with uncomplicated cystitis in accordance with current CLSI guidance. ESBL phenotype was detected via the Phoenix BDXpert system (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). Phenotypic ESBL confirmation testing, using disk diffusion with both cefotaxime and ceftazidime alone and in combination with clavulanic acid, was performed on isolates demonstrating indeterminate susceptibility patterns by the BDXpert system. Isolates with an elevated ertapenem MIC (>0.5 μg/ml) were screened for carbapenemase phenotype using the modified Hodge test. ","This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at a 636-bed, nonprofit, community teaching hospital in Pasadena, CA. The 50-bed level II trauma center and ED has an annual census of >70,000 patient visits. The study protocol was approved by the Huntington Hospital and the University of Southern California Institutional Review Boards with a waiver for informed consent.
All patients presented to the ED were identified based on a primary or secondary UTI diagnosis by ICD codes (ICD-9, 595.9 and 599.0; ICD-10, N30.00, N30.01, and N39.0) between July 2015 and June 2016. A total of 500 patients were randomly selected to represent approximately 10% of the population of interest, which was comprised of 350 patients discharged directly from the ED and 150 patients admitted to inpatient services. Exclusion criteria were the following: (i) <18 years of age, (ii) transferred to an outside hospital within 48 h of initial presentation, (iii) refused evaluation and/or treatment, and/or (iv) incomplete medical record. Only the first visit was counted as the index visit for patients with multiple ED visits during the study period. Relevant patient demographic, laboratory, and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record using a structured data collection form and entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University), an electronic data capture tool hosted at the University of Southern California.","Urinalysis was performed in all study patients, and the results were positive in >99% (497/500) of patients.

Strain susceptibility to clarithromycin and levofloxacin was tested by E test (MIC Evaluator, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK and Liofilchem, Roseto degli Abruzzi, TE, Italy) as previously described (Boyanova et al., 2008). In brief, H. pylori suspensions (equivalent to 2–3 McFarland turbidity standards) were inoculated onto blood Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Oxoid, UK). After the plates were dried, E test strips were placed onto the plates and the plates were incubated in microaerophilic conditions (CampyGen, Oxoid, UK) at 37°C for 48–72 h. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were read according to the supplier's recommendations. The strain susceptibility to amoxicillin, metronidazole, and tetracycline was tested by a breakpoint susceptibility testing method with several consecutive antibiotic concentrations (Boyanova et al., 2008). The breakpoint susceptibility testing method was used as an suitable technique since in our previous study, the category agreement between the results of the method and E test or agar dilution method results has been good (>93%) (Boyanova et al., 2008). The antimicrobial agents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo. H. pylori suspensions equivalent to 2–3 Mc Farland turbidity standards were inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Oxoid, UK) with 5% sheep blood, containing 0.12, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L amoxicillin or 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/L metronidazole, or 1 and 2 mg/L tetracycline. The plates were incubated in microaerophilic conditions (CampyGen, Oxoid, UK) at 37 °C for 2–3 days. Control strains used for the susceptibility testing methods were as previously described (Boyanova et al., 2008). Resistance rates of H. pylori strains from 62 untreated elderly patients aged >65 years in 2011–2016 were compared to those of 171 other adults by both EUCAST breakpoints for H. pylori and previously used breakpoints (EUCAST). Non-selective medium plates were used as a control of strain viability. Clarithromycin and levofloxacin MICs were calculated. As in our prior publication, primary Helicobacter pylori resistance rates were evaluated in strains from 92 patients aged ≥60 years in 1996–2003, the rates were compared to those in 85 patients in the same age group in 2011–2016 (Boyanova et al., 2003). To make possible the comparison between the resistance rates of the strains from these patients' groups, the breakpoints used in the prior study were employed. For the same reason, the resistance evolution was evaluated by the previously used breakpoints. The EUCAST resistance breakpoints for H. pylori were: >8 mg/L metronidazole, >0.5 mg/L clarithromycin, >0.125 mg/L amoxicillin, >1 mg/L tetracycline and >1 mg/L levofloxacin (EUCAST). The previously used breakpoints were: >8 mg/L metronidazole, >1 mg/L clarithromycin, >0.5 mg/L amoxicillin, >4 mg/L tetracycline and >1 mg/L ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin (Boyanova et al., 2003).","In 2011–2016, antibiotic susceptibility of 233 H. pylori strains, involving 62 strains from untreated elderly patients aged 66–93 years (mean age 73.5 years) and 171 strains from untreated younger adults aged 19–64 years (mean age 44.7 years) was evaluated (Table 1). Informed consent was obtained from the patients in the gastroenterology units. To compare resistance evolution in the older patients over time, resistance rates in 92 patients aged ≥60 years in 1996–2003 were compared to those in 85 patients in the same age group in 2011–2016 (Boyanova et al., 2003). In the previous study, the H. pylori positive patients aged ≥60 years included 28 ulcer patients, 70 non-ulcer patients and 5 gastric cancer patients (Boyanova et al., 2003). The patients evaluated during the last 6 years were aged 60 to 93 years (mean age, 70.3 years) and involved 38 men and 47 women, 17 peptic ulcer and 68 non-ulcer patients.","In 2011–2016, amoxicillin resistance rate in the elderly patients aged >65 years was evaluated by both EUCAST breakpoints and previous breakpoints and was 1.6 and 0%, respectively. Resistance rates by both breakpoint systems were the same to metronidazole (35.5%), clarithromycin (22.6%), tetracycline (1.6%), levofloxacin (32.3%) and metronidazole + clarithromycin (8.1%). There were no significant differences between the resistance rates of the strains from the patients aged >65 years and those from the younger adults (p ≥ 0.196), (Table 2).",untreated,"In 2011–2016, antibiotic susceptibility of 233 H. pylori strains, involving 62 strains from untreated elderly patients aged 66–93 years (mean age 73.5 years) and 171 strains from untreated younger adults aged 19–64 years (mean age 44.7 years) was evaluated.

In each instance the two morphologies displayed different capsular types; both morphologies from each patient isolate were included in the analysis.
167 colonizing strains, previously described by our group [14], were included for comparison. Briefly, 882 colonizing strains were collected from 57 healthy male and 95 healthy, nonpregnant female college students between January and February of 2001 as part of a cross-sectional survey. After obtaining written informed consent at enrollment, a study recruiter collected throat and mouth swabs. Participants self-collected initial-void urine and anal orifice specimens, and women collected vaginal specimens using a tampon. Following enrollment, all GBS-positive participants and a random sample of those negative for GBS were invited to partake in the four follow-up visits. Participants were followed at three-week intervals for a total of 12 weeks. At each follow-up visit participants provided urine, anal orifice and vaginal (if relevant) specimens. Additional throat swabs were obtained at one of the four follow-up visits. The Health Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan approved the study protocol (IRB file number 4133).
PFGE was performed on 882 GBS isolates cultured from the anal orifice, vagina, urine, throat, and mouth. Separate dendrograms were constructed, using BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium), for each participant to determine which isolates were unique. An isolate was considered unique if it had > 3 bands that were different from the other isolates from that individual. All unique isolates from each individual were selected for further analysis (n = 167).",,,"486 invasive strains were collected from 482 patients through the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, Bureau of Communicable Diseases, Invasive Bacterial Laboratory Surveillance System between 1998 and 2002.

The monitored infections include bacteraemia and fungaemia (Objective A), outpatient respiratory infections (Objective B), pneumonia in hospitalized patients (Objective C), wound infections (Objective D), and urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients (Objective E). Participating North American institutions during 1997–2000 included up to 30 medical centres in the US and eight in Canada.

The frequency of BSI due to selected pathogens in the SENTRY Program should be interpreted in light of the sampling method used. SENTRY collects the first 20 consecutive blood culture isolates from each participant hospital monthly, rather than all consecutive isolates. This has the effect of giving equal representation to each participating institution, regardless of size or patient characteristics and samples centres year round.

Additional demographic and epidemiological data were recorded on a data form to be included with each isolate. The judgment as to whether the isolate was nosocomial or community-onset was made by each participating centre based upon standard criteria (patient with bacteraemia judged to be clinically significant where blood cultures were obtained greater than 48 h after admission were judged to have nosocomial infection). Importantly, each laboratory was instructed to use its own criteria to determine clinical significance of a positive blood culture and to send only isolates felt to be clinically significant (i.e. not contaminants).

Inclusion criteria were patients with deep S. aureus or S. epidermidis infections after fracture fixation (fracture fixation infection, FFI) or prosthetic joint surgery (prosthetic joint infection, PJI) of the major joints or long bones of the lower extremity. Therefore, FFIs and PJIs involving the hip-, knee- and upper ankle-joint as well as femur, tibia and fibula were included in the study. Implant-associated infections were defined according to published guidelines: bacterial growth at the site of interest in combination with pseudarthrosis, implant-loosening/failure or local and systemic signs suggesting a surgical site infection. Bacterial growth was defined as detection of bacteria in at least one tissue sample, collected from the affected site of interest [1], [14]. These criteria reflect the standard institutional requirement for diagnosis of infection and commencement of surgical and medical treatment at our centre. Osteomyelitis without the presence of an implant and infections around an external fixation pin were excluded. The presence of bacterial growth around an implant without any clinical signs of infection was defined as contamination and these patients were excluded","In total, 163 patients met inclusion criteria with a S. aureus or S. epidermidis ODRI of the major joints or long bones of the lower extremity. Of the entire study population, 69% were male and the mean age was 54 (±17) years (range: 19–94 years). The older cohort comprised 64 patients (38%), 50% of whom were male and the mean age was 72 (±9) years. The “older” cohort had a more compromised health-status, with a mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 4.9 (range: 0–11) compared with 1.5 for younger patients. More than one third of older patients were diabetic (36%), which was greater than for younger patients (9%). Chronic immunosuppression was similarly greater in older versus younger patients (41% vs. 16%), whilst obesity rates were similar in both populations (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) [24]. Smoking was less common within the older population than in younger patients (17% vs. 38%) (Table 2).",,"This prospective study was performed from 2011 until 2013 at a level-one trauma centre with a high volume unit for septic and reconstructive surgery.

CIP susceptibility has been systematically tested only since 2003. Breakpoint susceptibility testing was systematically performed from October 1995 to November 2007 for CLR and MET, mainly to provide early information to clinicians. The main method allowing the final susceptibility testing was the disk diffusion method used for the currently tested antibiotics, which varies along the study according to the guidelines of treatment. In the absence of formal recommendations, owing to the important gap between MICs for susceptible and resistant H. pylori strains and according to a previous study of our population (18), strains were classified as susceptible to the antibiotics if growth inhibition zones were >40 mm without any mutant colony in the susceptibility area. The use of this constant breakpoint (up to the end of 2009) based on our clinical practice has the advantage of rendering the results homogeneous according to the definition of resistance.

The hospital and its clinical laboratory are accredited by the Joint Commission of International Accreditation (JCIA) and designated as a technical partner of the NTP. The laboratory participates in external quality control surveys with the College of American Pathologists (CAP). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) susceptibility has further been validated by the Supranational Laboratory of the WHO. The NTP, through its provincial and district level network, achieved 100% DOTS coverage with a 50% detection rate for smear-positives in 2006. Diagnosis within the NTP in conformity with the DOTS policy is based on smear microscopy. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) and second-line therapy are not offered within the national program as yet. There are only a few laboratories in the country offering DST for MTB. The Aga Khan University laboratory has the widest DST network, in the sense that it receives specimens collected through more than 175 collection units located in major cities and towns across the country. Specimens for TB cultures are requested by physicians as required and are received through passive specimen collection. All of the specimens collected at each of the collection units are sent to the main laboratory in Karachi for TB cultures and DST. Specimens are transported in a controlled environment to reach the main laboratory within 24 hours of collection. As such the data presented here include representation from different parts of the country. Over the last 4 years the Aga Khan University received 12 000–15 000 specimens annually for MTB culture with a 15–20% positivity rate.
In the absence of a national DST program the data presented here were not collected in a programmed survey of drug resistance but obtained as part of routine analysis of specimens submitted to the laboratory between January 1990 and June 2007.

The susceptibility interpretive criteria used were those published in NCCLS document M100-S14 (40). The nonsusceptible category was defined as isolates with MICs in the intermediate and resistant category. For the purpose of the present study, ciprofloxacin MICs of ≥4 μg/ml were used to define the nonsusceptible category. An MIC of ≥4 μg/ml was chosen because of the association of this degree of resistance with mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of genes encoding DNA topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase A (21, 43). The antimicrobial agents were supplied by their respective manufacturers or were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Erythromycin-nonsusceptible isolates were further classified as having either the M or MLSB phenotype. Isolates that were erythromycin nonsusceptible and clindamycin susceptible were classified as having the M phenotype, and those that were not susceptible to both erythromycin and clindamycin were classified as having the MLSB phenotype (22, 30, 46). Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance (intermediate isolates were not included) to three or more of the following antimicrobial agents: penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, TMP-SMX, and ciprofloxacin.

Patients were identified by reviewing the results of our hospital's microbiology laboratory.

Isolates were identified as S. pneumoniae by standard laboratory techniques. A standardized data form including demographic and clinical information was completed retrospectively for each episode of pneumococcal infection. Pneumococcal meningitis was defined as either a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture that was positive for S. pneumoniae or a CSF pleocytosis (>5 white blood cells/mm3) plus a blood culture positive for S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal pneumonia required a chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia in addition to the positive culture.

EUCAST14 susceptibility testing methodology was gradually introduced in the diagnostic and reference laboratories in Scotland during 2013. This may have resulted in small proportions of isolates that would have been reported as ‘susceptible’ under CSLI15 methodology being reported as ‘resistant’ under the EUCAST methodology later in the study period. Testing and reporting practice varied between laboratories, meaning that not all isolates were tested against all antibiotics. From the standard testing panel across NHS Scotland, antibiotics were grouped into seven categories:12 (i) agents used for the treatment of UTI in Scotland (ciprofloxacin/co-amoxiclav/nitrofurantoin/trimethoprim); (ii) extended-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin/amoxicillin); (iii) first- and second-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime/cefalexin); (iv) third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftazidime); (v) carbapenems (meropenem/ertapenem); (vi) aminoglycosides (gentamicin); and (vii) tetracyclines. Isolates were categorized as susceptible if susceptible to all antibiotics tested; resistant if resistant to one of the antibiotics tested; and MDR if resistant to at least one antibiotic in each of three or more categories. Patients with more than one isolate in the study period had the most resistant isolate selected or a random isolate selected if they were in the same resistance category.","NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) hosts national health and demographic data on behalf of NHS Scotland. In Scotland, all individuals have a unique patient identifier, the Community Health Index (CHI) number, which enables records for the same patient to be linked across multiple datasets.11 Within the IIP, the CHI is used to link specific data; patient identifiers are then removed for anonymized analysis. The Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Urinary Isolates in Scotland (SARUIS) dataset records culture and susceptibility data for a large, representative subset of all positive urine isolates in Scotland.12 All NHS Boards are required to submit data on the first 400 consecutive positive urine samples per calendar quarter. Demographic data were obtained from SARUIS. The study cohort was identified from records with a valid CHI number in the SARUIS dataset as patients ≥16 years old with a clinical urine isolate taken in the community between January 2012 and June 2015. SARUIS records susceptibility data for up to 14 antibiotics for each isolate. 
","Within the study period 40984 (62%) of 66194 urine isolates in SARUIS met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11674 (28%) were susceptible, 18445 (45%) were resistant and 10892 (27%) were MDR, and E. coli accounted for 73% of all isolates (Table 1). More than half of all isolates were from people ≥65 years old, 79% were from female patients and 9% were from care home residents (Table 1). One-third of patients had a Charlson comorbidity score of ≥1, but almost three-quarters had been prescribed drugs from ≥5 classes in the previous 12 months and 36% had a hospital stay in the previous 12 months (Table 1). Just over one-third of patients had no antibiotic prescriptions in the prior 6 months and 5% had at least four different antibiotics (Table 1). A total of 30% had ≥14 DDDs of antibiotic in the preceding 6 months and the mean time since last antibiotic prescription in the prior 12 months was 75 days (SD = 90) the median was 35 days (IQR = 104).",,"The Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Urinary Isolates in Scotland (SARUIS) dataset records culture and susceptibility data for a large, representative subset of all positive urine isolates in Scotland.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of gonococcal isolates was tested locally at the laboratories related to the STI centres; each isolate was tested for its susceptibility to penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime (as this was first-choice therapy when implementing GRAS in June 2008) using Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints were 2 mg/l or greater for penicillin, 1 mg/l or greater for ciprofloxacin, 2 mg/l or greater for tetracycline and over 0.5 mg/l for cefotaxime, according to guidelines recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. To enable comparability of the microbiological data, a quality control system was developed for GRAS, based on the standards for quality control in surveillance of antibiotic resistance that were devised by the Dutch Foundation of the Working Party on Antibiotic Policy.9 At the beginning of participation in GRAS, the laboratories tested a panel of four control strains (including N gonorrhoeae ATCC49226 and three strains kindly provided by C Ison). Each laboratory was allowed to use its own methods, including the agar medium, but had to identify the MIC of each antibiotic for the four reference strains. The MIC of the ATCC reference strain had to be within the boundaries prescribed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.","GRAS is implemented within the present Dutch national STI surveillance network, in which 32 STI centres and laboratories across eight regions provide free STI testing and care to people in specific high-risk groups, including those who wish to be tested anonymously.1 This system of testing and care was set up in addition to the routine national health services, to reach people who might otherwise not seek timely STI care. The population under study in GRAS was all patients in participating STI centres who were diagnosed with a gonorrhoea infection between July 2006 and July 2008. From July 2006 until July 2008, all participating STI centres collected a sample for culture and susceptibility testing from each gonorrhoea patient. In July 2006, GRAS was implemented in its first participating STI centre. Throughout the years 2006 to 2008, the project was implemented further, and as of June 2008, it included 13 of the Dutch STI centres, representing 83% of the total population of clinic attendees. Three STI centres stopped participating in 2007 for logistic or financial reasons.","Between July 2006 and July 2008, susceptibility testing for N gonorrhoeae was performed for isolates from 1556 patients (174 in 2006, 939 in 2007 and 443 in the first half of 2008), covering 66% of all patients (n = 2377) diagnosed in the participating STI centres (since they started or till they stopped participating). No laboratories were excluded as comparable results were achieved for the quality control; the mean 2log (MIC) of the four reference strains of any laboratory did not differ more than 1.5 from the overall mean 2log (MIC) of each antibiotic.

The study took place at two sexual health clinics in Inner North London (clinics A and B). Both clinics follow the same diagnostic and treatment protocols, in keeping with national guidelines, but are operated by different medical teams and serve demographically diverse populations. In addition to the routine spectrum of services, clinic B also offers a weekly young person’s clinic for men and women under the age of 21 years. Patients attending both routine and young person’s clinic appointments with a new episode are offered a screen for STIs. With particular reference to N. gonorrhoeae infection, this includes urethral sampling in men and urethral and endocervical sampling in women for microscopy and direct inoculation on gonococcal culture medium. Pharyngeal and rectal samples are not routinely taken. A presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhoea is made based on the presence of Gram-negative diplococci on a Gram-stained smear. Patients with a presumptive diagnosis and those presenting as contact of a sexual partner with gonorrhoea are given antimicrobial therapy to treat infection with N. gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis at their initial visit (epidemiological treatment). All presumptive diagnoses of gonococcal infection are con®rmed by culture on Thayer± Martin medium. Ligase chain reaction (Abbott LCR, Maidenhead, UK) is used for the diagnosis of C. trachomatis in urethral (men) or endocercvical (females) samples. All patients attending the two clinics with a culture con®rmed diagnosis of gonococcal infection over a six-month period commencing 1 September 2000 were eligible for the study. Recruitment was also extended for one month in clinic B in order to increase the number of heterosexuals with gonorrhoea. All patients received routine care and follow-up for their infection, as outlined above, including discussion with a health adviser. Partner noti®cation (patient or provider referral) was initiated for the preceding month for symptomatic men and three months for women and asymptomatic men. Patients who did not attend for followup received at least one reminder (letter or phone call). During the study period a proforma to standardize data collection and documentation of characteristics of patients with gonorrhoea was used to replace the current non-standardized interview.","Of the 213 heterosexuals diagnosed with gonorrhoea during the study period 209 (98%) records were available for analysis. Seventy patients (33.5%) were seen at clinic A and 139 (66.5%) at clinic B. Overall 83 (39.7%) patients were 20 years or younger. Younger patients were more likely to be female (66.2% vs 34.1%, P50.005) and to have attended clinic B (82% vs 56.3%, P50.005). All patients had genital samples taken for the diagnosis of gonorrhoea. Pharyngeal swabs were taken in 16 (23.5%) women and 13 (11.7%) men. Rectal swabs were taken in 16 (16.3%) women but not in men. Genital infection with N. gonorrhoeae was detected in all women. However, ®ve also had pharyngeal and seven had rectal infection.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion technique in Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% horse blood, a 5-μg oxacillin disk being used to screen penicillin-resistant strains. Strains with a zone diameter of <26 mm were considered to be non-susceptible to penicillin, and the MIC was determined by the E test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). All PNSP isolates from each laboratory were sent to the regional coordinating center for determination of the MICs for penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime, using the reference agar dilution method in Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% horse blood. An inoculum was prepared by culturing 10 colonies in 5 mL of brain-heart broth incubated for 3 h at 37 °C; 104–105 CFU per spot were applied using a Steers replicator onto agar plates containing serial dilutions of antibiotics.

Three appropriate quality control strains (Sp53858, Sp32475, and Sp1600) provided by the Pneumococci Reference Center (MD Geslin) were included in each run. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent which completely inhibited bacterial growth. Susceptibility categories were determined using the Comité de l'Antibiogramme de la Société Française de Microbiologic (CA-SFM) guidelines [2], where pneumococci are considered to be susceptible to penicillin when the MIC is ≤0.06 mg/L, to exhibit intermediate susceptibility when the MIC is 0.12-1 mg/L, and to be resistant when the MIC is ≥2 mg/L. For amoxicillin and cefotaxime, the breakpoints were ≤0.5 mg/L and >2 mg/L, respectively.

In 1998, all three reference laboratories used susceptibility-testing panels that included penicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, meropenem, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, rifampin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, trovafloxacin, and quinupristin–dalfopristin. Analyses of trends over time were not possible for amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and quinupristin–dalfopristin, because of changes in panel composition. In 1998, levofloxacin and trovafloxacin were substituted for ofloxacin, which was used from 1995 to 1997. Serotyping with use of the quellung reaction was performed at the CDC and at the Minnesota Department of Health Laboratory. Isolates were defined as susceptible, having intermediate resistance, or highly resistant to the agents tested according to the NCCLS definitions.20 We defined an isolate as “resistant” for this analysis if it had either an intermediate or a high level of resistance. In analyses of resistance to multiple drug classes, we grouped the penicillins, cephalosporins, and meropenem into one drug class; isolates resistant to any of these agents (penicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, or meropenem) were considered resistant to antimicrobial agents of the β-lactam class. Ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin were grouped as fluoroquinolone agents; other agents were considered to belong to their own drug classes.","In 1998, the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance program monitored invasive pneumococcal infections in greater Portland, Oregon (three counties; estimated 1998 population, 1.4 million); San Francisco County, California (population, 0.7 million); greater Minneapolis and St. Paul (seven counties; population, 2.5 million); greater Baltimore (six counties; population, 2.4 million); greater Atlanta (eight counties; population, 2.8 million); five counties in Tennessee (population, 2.2 million); greater Rochester, New York (seven counties; population, 1.1 million); and the State of Connecticut (population, 3.3 million). The total population under surveillance for 1998 was 16.5 million. All sites except greater Rochester began surveillance on or before July 1, 1995; we excluded data from greater Rochester from analyses of trends over time. A case of invasive pneumococcal disease was defined by the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, joint fluid, or pleural fluid) from a resident of the surveillance area during 1995 through 1998. To identify cases, surveillance personnel periodically contacted all clinical microbiology laboratories in their areas. Audits of laboratory records were conducted every six months to ensure complete reporting. Surveillance personnel collected information on patients by means of a standardized questionnaire that included demographic data, information on clinical characteristics, and disease outcome.","During 1998, 4013 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were reported; isolates were available for susceptibility testing for 3475 (87 percent; range, 81 percent to 97 percent of isolates from each reporting site). Most isolates came from blood (98 percent). The cumulative incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease for calendar year 1998 ranged from 21 cases per 100,000 population in Tennessee to 33 cases per 100,000 population in California. After adjustment according to the age and race distribution of the U.S. population, the overall cumulative incidence was 23 cases per 100,000 population",,"In 1998, the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance program monitored invasive pneumococcal infections in various countries across America. A case of invasive pneumococcal disease was defined by the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, joint fluid, or pleural fluid) from a resident of the surveillance area during 1995 through 1998.

The current population is around 180000. During the second survey the population was asked about coughs, and individuals with coughs of at least 3 weeks’ duration were encouraged to provide sputum specimens. Since 1989 project staff have been based at peripheral clinics and at the hospital to screen patients with chronic cough, and patients can self-report to clinics or the hospital at any time. All patients diagnosed as having tuberculosis start treatment in hospital, following Malawi government guidelines. Treatment is free. Since 1986 smear positive patients have received the daily short course regimen as recommended by the IUATLD, consisting of streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. At 2 months, or later if they are still smear positive, they change to out-patient treatment with isoniazid and thiacetazone. Smear negative patients receive the IUATLD recommended standard regimen, consisting of 1 month of hospital treatment with daily streptomycin, isoniazid and thiacetazone, followed by 11 months of out-patient treatment with isoniazid and thiacetazone. Patients who relapse receive the short course regimen, including three times weekly ethambutol during the continuation phase. Since January 1997, in response to the high prevalence of HIV and associated reactions to thiacetazone, ethambutol has been used instead of thiacetazone. All patients being treated for tuberculosis in the hospital are seen by project staff. Since 1988 adults have been tested for HIV, after counselling and if consent is given. Out-patient care is organised by project staff, who see the patients monthly, either at agreed meeting places or at the patient’s home. Tablets are counted to check compliance, patients are asked about any drug reactions, and they are given the next month’s supply of drugs. Follow-up sputum specimens are requested from patients with recurrence of cough, and routinely at 5 months and at the end of treatment from smear positive patients. In this new report we have included in the analyses of initial resistance all patients without any history of previous tuberculosis, whether or not they had previously been seen by project staff.

As such, they were categorized as “old urban” areas. The remaining five districts were originally regarded as suburban areas. Of these, three were recently upgraded to urban areas on the basis of rapid economic development and had a population density that ranged from 2,800 to 5,300 individuals/km2, although the migrating population was not counted. We categorized these three areas as “new urban.” The two other areas remained “suburban,” and their population densities ranged from 1,500 to 2,500 individuals/km2. Patients were considered eligible if they were 16 years or older, resided in the abovementioned catchment areas, suffered from smear-positive pulmonary TB without a history of TB treatment, and agreed to participate in this study. Eligible patients who visited the local TB care units were recruited consecutively from July 2007 to March 2009. Information about no previous TB treatment was based on interviews conducted by pre-trained health care staff and medical records kept for registration with the National TB Program in district TB centers.","In total, 546 newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary TB patients were recruited. From 506 culture-positive cases, microbial isolates were collected from 495 patients (97.8%), of which six were infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria.

Because of insufficient quality of the extracted DNA samples, 467 MTB isolates further underwent spoligotyping and 465 underwent VNTR typing (Figure 1).

The susceptibility to fosfomycin (breakpoints: 4, 16, 64 mg/L) was tested in Mueller–Hinton broth supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/L). The inoculum was prepared by making a saline suspension (in 20 mL NaCl/3% Tween® 80) from three single colonies selected from an agar plate after 18–24 h of incubation. The bacterial suspensions were transferred with a replicator to 96-well-microtitre plates. Accuracy and purity of the inoculum (5 × 104–5 × 105 cfu/mL) were verified by subcultures on blood agar plates. To determine the susceptibility to chloramphenicol, agar diffusion tests were carried out on Mueller–Hinton agar (Oxoid) using a bacterial inoculum equivalent to a 0.5 MacFarland standard and discs containing 30 µg chloramphenicol (Oxoid). Isolates yielding zone sizes of ≥18 and ≤12 mm were considered susceptible and resistant, respectively. As quality controls, two defined E. coli strains (ATCC 25922 and 35218) were included in the testing procedures throughout the study.
","The study was conducted between November 2005 and January 2006 in Tamale, the capital of the Northern Region of Ghana. Despite a population of ∼350 000, the city has a rather rural character with hamlets and thatched, mud-wall huts scattered over a vast area. Antibiotics are available from numerous licensed and non-licensed sources. At the peri-urban Bulpeila Health Centre, healthcare workers collected faecal specimens from 243 children with acute diarrhoea and from 124 population control children from the same area without acute diarrhoea. The mean age of the children was 13 months (0–11 years); further details of the study population have been published elsewhere.2 The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee, University for Development Studies, Tamale, and informed written consent was obtained from the children's guardians.
","From children with diarrhoea, we isolated two isolates each of Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica Group 2, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella boydii and S. flexneri as well as one isolate each of S. enterica serovar Colindale and S. enterica serovar Typhi. One isolate of Campylobactercoli and S. boydii each was isolated from control subjects. Yersinia, Aeromonas or Vibrio species were not detected. Susceptibility testing of the six Salmonella and five Shigella isolates was performed in Tamale by disc diffusion and confirmed and extended in Germany using the breakpoint microdilution method. The results revealed substantial antimicrobial resistance of the shigellae, particularly to the drugs most frequently used in Northern Ghana, i.e. amoxicillin/ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. In contrast, the salmonellae were more susceptible, and only one S. Typhimurium isolate displayed a similar resistance pattern as the shigellae (Table 1). Although the number of isolates tested was small, the data indicate that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol are most likely not effective anymore in the treatment of childhood shigellosis in Northern Ghana. Similarly, high proportions of multidrug-resistant Shigella isolates in children and adults have been reported from the Accra region of Ghana.5 Studies with more isolates are warranted for Northern Ghana, including Salmonella Typhi isolates, which have been found to be equally multidrug-resistant in Accra.",,"The study was conducted between November 2005 and January 2006 in Tamale, the capital of the Northern Region of Ghana.

A barcode reader was used to minimize transcription errors when inputting PIN numbers. In case of errors, assays were repeated using the remaining specimens from first specimens. Subsequent procedures were based upon Xpert MTB/RIF results: if RR-TB was not detected or MTB was not detected, no further procedures were performed. If RR-TB was detected, archived specimens were retrieved, decontaminated and the resultant sputum deposits were inoculated on LJ and pyruvate agar media according to standard operating procedures (Stop TB Partnership, 2014). The media were incubated at 37 °C and growth of MTB was observed weekly for up to 6 weeks. Part of the deposit was inoculated on LJ agar slants in 5 mL cryo-vials for shipment to a Supranational TB Reference Laboratory (SRL) in Antwerp, Belgium for external quality assurance.

The city is divided into six administrative districts (Firaisana). The recruits were patients of all ages attending for the first time one of three health centers in poor (Isotry), moderate (Ivato) and comfortable (clinical biology laboratory of the Institut Pasteur or care centre in private practice) areas of the city. They were also enrolled before treatment. Individuals with a current history of infection or fever syndrome or a history of hospitalization within the past 12 months or antibiotic therapy within three months were excluded from the study. If several members of the same household could be included, just one was selected by randomization. The sample size was calculated on the basis of an estimate of the prevalence of ESBL-PE carriage in the population of between 10% and 20%: the recruitment of 150 subjects at each site allowed an accuracy of 5 to 7%, with alpha risk 5% and power 80%.
","Of the 515 patients questioned, 484 were enrolled. The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.03 and the median age was 28 years (Inter Quartile Range - IQR: 9–40 yrs). Three age groups were distinguished: 0–4 years (12.8%), 5–14 years (23.8%), 15 years and more (63.4%). Most heads of household had at least a high school level of occupation (45.1% university level and 40.8% secondary school level); furthermore, in view of their occupation, 46.7% were unskilled or semi-skilled workers and 4.7% were professionally inactive.",,"This study was conducted in Antananarivo (Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo or CUA), the capital city of Madagascar, located in the central highlands.

Susceptibility testing was performed at one of two major laboratories with expertise in culturing H. pylori (Veteran Affairs Medical Center-Baylor College of Medicine and Microbiology Specialists, Inc., both in Houston, Texas). At least one MIC value obtained by agar dilution or epsilometer test (also called E-test) had to be reported for clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. We used only one isolate from each patient for our analysis. When MIC results were available for antrum and corpus biopsy specimens, the higher of the two values was selected. In 1 of the 20 included trials, susceptibility testing was performed by both agar dilution and E-test. In 106 patients, MIC results were available by both methods for all three drugs. For these patients, only results obtained by agar dilution were included because agar dilution is the testing method preferred by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The NCCLS interpretative criteria for agar dilution were used to classify the susceptibility of isolates to clarithromycin. An MIC less than or equal to 0.25 µg/mL indicated susceptibility, and an MIC of at least 1 µg/mL indicated resistance (5). The E-test strip allows MICs that may not correspond to standard twofold dilutions obtained by agar dilution; therefore, the criterion for intermediate susceptibility by agar dilution was modified from 0.5 µg/mL to a range of greater than 0.25 µg/mL to less than 1 µg/mL. Because the NCCLS has not set interpretative criteria for susceptibility of H. pylori isolates to metronidazole, we used NCCLS criteria for anaerobes; an MIC less than or equal to 8 µg/mL indicated susceptibility and an MIC of at least 32 µg/mL indicated resistance. This resistance breakpoint has been correlated with treatment failures in patients receiving clarithromycin, metronidazole, and omeprazole (6). The intermediate category was modified from 16 µg/mL to a range of greater than 8 to µg/mL to less than 32 µg/mL. This allowed us to correlate E-test values with values obtained by agar dilution. In the analysis of resistance rates by risk factor, we did not use an intermediate category for clarithromycin or metronidazole. Isolates that fell into the intermediate range were classified as susceptible. A resistance breakpoint for amoxicillin has not been determined. Isolates were considered susceptible if the MIC was less than or equal to 0.25 µg/mL (7) and were considered resistant if the MIC exceeded 0.25 µg/mL. In two trials, ampicillin was used in place of amoxicillin for susceptibility testing with the E-test. Ampicillin and amoxicillin are generally considered to behave the same way in vitro, and the NCCLS states that ampicillin is considered the class representative for amoxicillin and ampicillin (5).","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invited pharmaceutical companies that had H. pylori development programs to assist in developing a program for evaluating pretreatment H. pylori antimicrobial resistance in patients with ulcers.

Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) containing 5% horse blood was used for antibiotic susceptibility testing. For bacterial inoculation, a 3 McFarland suspension was prepared in BHI broth. This suspension was spread over the agar plate, and a single gradient strip (Etest, bioMérieux, France) was placed on each 90 mm Petri dish. Plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 35˚C for three days. For testing amoxicillin susceptibility, a H. pylori-specific gradient strip with a broader gradient spectrum (0.002–32 µg/ml) was used. Strains with a clarithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value ≥1 µg/ml, a metronidazole MIC value ≥8 µg/ml, an amoxicillin MIC value ≥0.5 µg/ml and a tetracycline MIC value ≥1 µg/ml were considered resistant according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) standards.","The study included 93 H. pylori strains isolated from the biopsy samples obtained during esophagogastroduodenoscopy of 93 pediatric patients who had been evaluated in the Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology for various gastrointestinal symptoms and had not been treated for H. pylori before the biopsy.

The presence of β-lactamase was tested for all isolates of H. influenzae by a chromogenic cephalosporin (nitrocefin) disc method. MICs were determined using the Etest® susceptibility method according to the manufacturer's instructions (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Disc diffusion susceptibility testing was carried out according to CLSI methodology.4 Susceptibility of H. influenzae to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2/1), ampicillin, azithromycin, cefaclor, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and clarithromycin was evaluated by Etest®. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1/19), tetracycline and chloramphenicol susceptibility were evaluated by disc diffusion. Susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2/1), azithromycin, cefaclor, cefuroxime ofloxacin and vancomycin was evaluated by Etest®. Erythromycin, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1/19), tetracycline and chloramphenicol susceptibilities were evaluated by disc diffusion. CLSI breakpoints were applied,5 except for macrolides and clindamycin, where bioMérieux Etest® breakpoints for incubation in CO2 were used. In addition, susceptibilities, as defined by EUCAST and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoints, were reported where applicable6,7 to assess whether adoption of these breakpoints would affect susceptibility. EUCAST and PK/PD breakpoints were not applied for macrolides or clindamycin because, unlike CLSI, these are not adjusted for incubation in CO2 by bioMérieux. The MIC breakpoints used are shown in Table 1 and the disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints are shown in Table 2.",Isolates of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were obtained from clinical materials taken from adults and paediatric patients (outpatients who attended the university hospital) with community-acquired respiratory infections.

Soria Melguizo S.A., Madrid, Spain); and two Sensititre (Radiometer/Copenhagen Company, Denmark). In five laboratories, both disc-diffusion and Etest methods (AB-Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) were used and two laboratories used a disc-diffusion susceptibility method. Among the seven laboratories using a disc-diffusion method, NCCLS methodology was used by six laboratories and the Neosensitab system (Rosco, Sweden; user’s guide available at the website http://www.rosco.dk/uk/userguides/neo-sensitabs_o.pdf) was used by one. Results were scored as susceptible, intermediate or resistant according to NCCLS criteria in 39 laboratories. One laboratory used the Neosensitab system. No significant differences in susceptibility results were found between the laboratory using the Neosensitab system criteria and the laboratories using NCCLS criteria. Quality-control results of this laboratory also agreed with those obtained by reference laboratories. The protocol for S. aureus susceptibility testing included oxacillin and vancomycin. A specific guideline for detection of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides was recommended by EARSS to all hospital participants based on published data.8 In addition, data on antimicrobial susceptibility to other antibiotics were also considered, in case a participating laboratory routinely tested them. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance to three or more of the antimicrobials tested. The number of strains studied, by antibiotic and method, was not always equal to the total number of strains.","To fulfil the goal of obtaining representative data, participating hospitals were chosen to meet the following criteria: (i) coverage of at least 20% of the Spanish population; (ii) different areas of the country covered; and (iii) different kinds of hospitals (size and category) represented. All clinical isolates of S. aureus obtained from blood in Spanish laboratories participating in the EARSS during 2000–2002 were included. Only the first invasive isolate per patient was reported. A questionnaire concerning some hospital characteristics (coverage, hospital type, number of beds, number of patients admitted/year, hospital departments), methods of antimicrobial susceptibility study and interpretation criteria was submitted to each participating centre. One isolate record form per patient was completed. This form included patient’s personal data (code, age, sex), hospital and departmental data and antibiotic susceptibility data. Hospitals sent standardized results to the Centro Nacional de Microbiología of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, where results were analysed and validated using the laboratory-based WHONET 5 program (WHO Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance). All records were carefully analysed by a clinical microbiologist. Duplicated isolates, more than one isolate per patient, were identified and deleted. Discrepancies and atypical results were resolved by telephone and the corresponding database records updated if necessary. At the end of each year, an annual report of all the data stored in the central database was sent to each participating laboratory to avoid possible disagreements.","Over the study period, the 40 participant hospitals reported data on 3113 invasive isolates of S. aureus, corresponding to the same number of patients: 903 in 2000, 1011 in 2001, and 1199 in 2002. Of these, 2008 strains (64.5%) were isolated from males and 1105 (35.5%) from females. Two hundred and thirty-three (7.5%) of the strains were isolated from children ≤14 years of age. Nosocomial infections (defined as infections acquired at least 48 h after admission) accounted for 2853 (91.6%) cases, and community-onset infections, 260 (8.4%). The incidence of invasive S. aureus nosocomial infections was 1.3 cases/1000 admitted patients. A total of 725 nosocomial oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were identified: 253 in 2000, 221 in 2001 and 251 in 2002.

The gradient strip method (E-test; bioMerieux) was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline and gentamicin according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ATCC C. jejuni 33560 was used as the control. MICs were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute’s guidelines for fastidious bacteria.[18] Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were compared with the resistance rates estimated in 2010 among hospitalized patients using the same susceptibility testing method, and in the same laboratory setting.[19]","This study was a part of a population-based laboratory surveillance programme in which C. jejuni isolates were systematically collected from stool samples of all the patients with diarrhoea in Split-Dalmatia County. The county encompasses 4534 km2, with a population of approximately 500,000 individuals, representing around 11% of the Croatian population. Samples were sent from diverse locations throughout the county from May 2012 to May 2013 and analyzed at University Hospital Centre (UHC) Split and the Public Health Institute (PHI) of Split. Patients hospitalized with gastroenteritis were defined as having a more severe clinical course.[6] During the study period, 5854 patients with diarrhoea were covered by the surveillance system, including all the patients hospitalized with gastroenteritis. Overall, 441 single-patient stool samples, each representing unique infection, were culture-positive for C. jejuni: 77 from patients hospitalized at the UHC Split, and 364 from outpatients submitted to PHI. Since the methods for isolation, susceptibility testing and molecular typing of these fastidious pathogens are technically demanding, expensive, labour-and-time intensive; we further analyzed a subset of these C. jejuni isolates including 77 (100%) hospital, and 77 (21%) outpatient isolates that were matched by date of laboratory submission to hospital isolates. The outpatient sample size assured an acceptable margin of error of 10% under assumption of 95% confidence level. Since subcultivation of one isolate was not successful, our final sample included 153 isolates: 76 of hospitalized patients and 77 of outpatients.","Out of 441 diarrheal stool samples which were found positive for C. jejuni by the surveillance system, 77 (17%) were from patients hospitalized with gastroenteritis. In this study, we analyzed Campylobacter isolates and patient’s characteristics of 76 hospitalized patients and 77 matched outpatients. The age of infected patients was bimodally distributed, with two peaks at 0–10 years and 51–60 years (Figure 1). Men were more frequently infected than women (p = .024; 91 men out of 153, or 59%). The majority of infections (66%) were diagnosed during the seasonal peak of the disease, from May to September.",,"This study was a part of a population-based laboratory surveillance programme in which C. jejuni isolates were systematically collected from stool samples of all the patients with diarrhoea in Split-Dalmatia County.

MICs were determined by the microdilution method according to CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines using Haemophilus test medium. β-lactamase production was determined by the nitrocefin test.

BLNAR (β-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant) included H. influenzae classified as R without β-lactamase producing pathogen (β-lactamase positive ampicillin-resistant = BLPAR), and the non-BLNAR group included strains classified as S and I.

The ratio of females to total in the BLNAR group was higher than in the non-BLNAR group, although the difference was not significant (Table II). In addition, there were 2 peaks in the age distribution of BLNAR pneumonia at 21–30 and 61–70 y (Figure 1). Respiratory disease was the most common underlying disease for each group (Table III). We could not find any obvious differences between the BLNAR and non-BLNAR groups in body temperature, laboratory data (leukocyte counts and C-reactive protein), heart rate, or percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) (Table II), although we found that BLNAR pneumonia occurred in younger individuals than non-BLNAR pneumonia (p<0.0079). The median PSI score was 69.2 (class I, 25%; class II, 25%; class III, 20%; class IV, 20%; class V, 10%).
